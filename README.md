## Contributing to DevKit

Adding new classes to DevKit should be added to the appropriate subspec section. Unique subspecs should include the source files, any limiting deployment targets and necessary dependencies. 

```ruby
  # CalendarPermissionsValidator
  s.subspec 'CalendarPermissionsValidator' do |sp|
    sp.ios.deployment_target = '11.0'
    sp.dependency 'DevKit/Extensions/StringExtension'
    sp.dependency 'DevKit/Extensions/UIAlertControllerExtension'
    sp.dependency 'DevKit/Extensions/UIApplicationExtension'
    sp.source_files = 'DevKit/DevKit/Classes/Utility/Validators/CalendarPermissionsValidator/*'
  end
```

All new additions should be code reviewed before merging into master.
